# ELMO_16CL with HD Video and Sound Capture
 
This is the the popular Elmo 16CL with the RPI HD camera that allows HD video and sound capture.    
The modified projector can run at 1440x1080 resolution which is better than expensive Elmo TVR16 models.    
The modification kit uses the state of the art components and included the RPI4 computer with the HD video camera.  
The combined video and audio are available over the HDMI cable which can be connected to the HDMI monitor and or an external video recorder.
For users that want to record to a VCR there is a converter that converts the HDMI to Composite NTSC to PAL video.

The real time video plus audio can also be  recorded to the internal 256GB SD micro card.  
The video recording as well as the exposure settings are controlled by two switches mounted at the front unit..  
Under normal operation, no RPI experience is needed but with some basic computer skills many more features became available  
in addition to the basic preview and record.  
Here is a test clip.
